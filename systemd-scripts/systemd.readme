Place the start and stop .sh your novasdr directory and adjust the paramaters to your needs.

Place the websdr.service in /usr/lib/systemd/system/

Edit it to your needs, as my parameters are probably not yours.

Then run: systemctl enable websdr.service

To start: systemctl start websdr

To stop: systemctl stop websdr

The scripts use killall, missing in Debian: apt install psmisc 

So it's installed.
