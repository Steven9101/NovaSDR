This project is distributed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3 (GPLv3).
See `LICENSE`.

Origin and attribution
----------------------

NovaSDR is a continuation of PhantomSDR-plus (a fork maintained by `magicint1337`),
which itself is derived from PhantomSDR work originating from:

  https://github.com/rhgndf

The Rust implementation is an independent rewrite, but it is based on the same overall
architecture and protocol and was developed with the upstream project as the reference.
Any portions of code and/or design derived from upstream are covered by GPLv3; therefore
this repository is licensed under GPLv3 as well.

Bundled artifacts and third-party software
------------------------------------------

NovaSDR includes third-party components and bundled generated artifacts (including
WebAssembly modules used by the browser UI). See `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md` for the current
inventory and attributions.

Frontend
--------

The UI lives in the `frontend/` directory and is versioned in this repository.
It may contain code and assets derived from upstream WebSDR work as well as additional
third-party dependencies. When distributing binaries or source, ensure the frontend’s
license and notices are included alongside this repository’s GPLv3 licensing.
